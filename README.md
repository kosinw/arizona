**Arizona** is a small, [statically-typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_type_checking), [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming) programming language focused on ease of use and readibility targeting [WebAssembly](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/a-cartoon-intro-to-webassembly/). **Arizona** uses [Binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen), a WebAssembly compiler backend, to generate fast and optimized WebAssembly code.

Arizona borrows syntactical similarities from Rust and is designed to be as flexible and simple to write as C but with more modern features. The original Arizona compiler was written in [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) for development speed and cross-platform† use.

> † Cross-platform as it targets both browsers and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## What is Arizona?
Arizona was started as a fun aside and independent research project by [Kosi Nwabueze](https://kosinw.com) in his senior year of high-school. The original goal of Arizona was to serve as a capstone project representing Kosi's research into compiler development and programming language design.
